"""Let's stick to the cars data some more. This time you want to find out which countries have a high cars per capita figure. 
In other words, in which countries do many people have a car, or maybe multiple cars.

Similar to the previous example, you'll want to build up a boolean Series, that you can then use to subset the cars DataFrame to select certain observations. If you want to do this in a one-liner, that's perfectly fine!"""
