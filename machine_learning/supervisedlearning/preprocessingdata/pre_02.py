"""Creating dummy variables
As Andy discussed in the video, scikit-learn does not accept non-numerical features.
 You saw in the previous exercise that the 'Region' feature contains very useful information that can predict life expectancy. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa has a lower life expectancy compared to Europe and Central Asia. Therefore, if you are trying to predict life expectancy, it would be preferable to retain the 'Region' feature. To do this,
 you need to binarize it by creating dummy variables, which is what you will do in this exercise."""
