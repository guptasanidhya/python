scene_one="SCENE 1: [wind] [clop clop clop] \nKING ARTHUR: Whoa there!  [clop clop clop] \nSOLDIER #1: Halt!  Who goes there?\nARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!\nSOLDIER #1: Pull the other one!\nARTHUR: I am, ...  and this is my trusty servant Patsy.  We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master.\nSOLDIER #1: What?  Ridden on a horse?\nARTHUR: Yes!\nSOLDIER #1: You're using coconuts!\nARTHUR: What?\nSOLDIER #1: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.\nARTHUR: So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--\nSOLDIER #1: Where'd you get the coconuts?\nARTHUR: We found them.\nSOLDIER #1: Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!\nARTHUR: What do you mean?\nSOLDIER #1: Well, this is a temperate zone.\nARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?\nSOLDIER #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?\nARTHUR: Not at all.  They could be carried.\nSOLDIER #1: What?  A swallow carrying a coconut?\nARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!\nSOLDIER #1: It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.\nARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.\nSOLDIER #1: Listen.  In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?\nARTHUR: Please!\nSOLDIER #1: Am I right?\nARTHUR: I'm not interested!\nSOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!\nSOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.  That's my point.\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that.\nARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!\nSOLDIER #1: But then of course a-- African swallows are non-migratory.\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah...\nSOLDIER #1: So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...  [clop clop clop] \nSOLDIER #2: Wait a minute!  Supposing two swallows carried it together?\nSOLDIER #1: No, they'd have to have it on a line.\nSOLDIER #2: Well, simple!  They'd just use a strand of creeper!\nSOLDIER #1: What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?\nSOLDIER #2: Well, why not?\n"
"""Word tokenization with NLTK
Here, you'll be using the first scene of Monty Python's Holy Grail, which has been pre-loaded as scene_one. Feel free to check it out in the IPython Shell!

Your job in this exercise is to utilize word_tokenize and sent_tokenize from nltk.tokenize to tokenize both words and sentences from Python strings - in this case, the first scene of Monty Python's Holy Grail.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the sent_tokenize and word_tokenize functions from nltk.tokenize.
Tokenize all the sentences in scene_one using the sent_tokenize() function.
Tokenize the fourth sentence in sentences, which you can access as sentences[3], using the word_tokenize() function.
Find the unique tokens in the entire scene by using word_tokenize() on scene_one and then converting it into a set using set().
Print the unique tokens found. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results!"""

# Import necessary modules
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
# Split scene_one into sentences: sentences
sentences = sent_tokenize(scene_one)
print(sentences)
# Use word_tokenize to tokenize the fourth sentence: tokenized_sent
tokenized_sent = word_tokenize(sentences[3])
print(tokenized_sent)

# Make a set of unique tokens in the entire scene: unique_tokens
unique_tokens = set(word_tokenize(scene_one))

# Print the unique tokens result
print(unique_tokens)
