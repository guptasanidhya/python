"""Predicting named entities in context
Models are statistical and not always right. Whether their predictions are correct depends on the training data and the text you're processing. Let's take a look at an example. The small English model is available as the variable nlp.

Instructions 1/2
50 XP
Process the text with the nlp object.
Iterate over the entities with the iterator ent and print the entity text and label."""

nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')


text = "New iPhone X release date leaked as Apple reveals pre-orders by mistake"

# Process the text
doc = nlp(text)

# Iterate over the entities
for ent in doc.ents:
    # print the entity text and label
