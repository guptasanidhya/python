"""Writing match patterns
In this exercise, you'll practice writing more complex match patterns using different token attributes and operators. A matcher is already initialized and available as the variable matcher.

Write one pattern that matches adjectives ('ADJ') followed by one or two 'NOUN's (one noun and one optional noun).
